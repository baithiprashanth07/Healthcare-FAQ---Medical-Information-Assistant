**Title:** Healthcare FAQ & Medical Information Assistant
**Subtitle:** A NeoStats AI Engineer Case Study
**Presented by:*Prashanth Baithi* 
**Date:** October 17, 2025

## Slide 2: Introduction & Problem Statement

**Heading:** Bridging the Information Gap in Healthcare

**Content:**
Patients and healthcare seekers frequently struggle to find accurate and timely information regarding medical conditions, symptoms, and general health advice. The vastness of online information can be overwhelming and often unreliable. This project addresses the critical need for a centralized, intelligent, and trustworthy source of medical information, accessible through a user-friendly chatbot interface.

## Slide 3: Use Case Objective

**Heading:** Empowering Users with Reliable Health Information

**Content:**
The primary objective was to develop an AI-powered chatbot capable of acting as a **Healthcare FAQ & Medical Information Assistant**. This assistant aims to:

*   Provide quick and accurate answers to common medical queries.
*   Retrieve information from a curated knowledge base of trusted medical documents.
*   Perform real-time web searches for the latest health updates or broader context.
*   Offer flexible response styles (concise or detailed) to suit user preferences.
*   Enable users to expand the knowledge base with their own documents.

## Slide 4: Solution Overview

**Heading:** An Intelligent Hybrid AI Chatbot

**Content:**
The solution is a Streamlit-based chatbot that integrates multiple advanced AI techniques. It functions as a hybrid system, combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for in-depth knowledge base queries with **Live Web Search** for dynamic, up-to-date information. The chatbot supports various Large Language Models (LLMs) and provides a customizable user experience through different response modes and system prompts.

## Slide 5: Technical Architecture & Stack

**Heading:** Robust and Modular Design for Scalability

**Content:**
The chatbot is built upon a modular architecture designed for maintainability and extensibility. The core technologies include:

*   **Framework**: Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
*   **LLM Providers**: Integration with OpenAI, Groq (Llama 3.1), and Google Gemini for diverse model capabilities.
*   **Vector Store**: FAISS for efficient similarity search and knowledge retrieval.
*   **Embeddings**: HuggingFace `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for semantic understanding.
*   **Web Search**: DuckDuckGo Search API for real-time external information.
*   **Document Processing**: LangChain for loading and chunking various document types (PDF, TXT).

## Slide 6: Key Features Implemented

**Heading:** Comprehensive Capabilities for Enhanced User Interaction

**Content:**

1.  **RAG Integration**: Leverages a FAISS vector store, populated with medical documents and HuggingFace embeddings, to provide contextually relevant answers from a curated knowledge base.
2.  **Live Web Search**: Dynamically performs web searches via DuckDuckGo to address queries requiring current information or knowledge outside the pre-loaded documents.
3.  **Response Modes**: Offers users the flexibility to choose between 

concise (summarized) and detailed (in-depth) response styles, tailored to their immediate information needs.
4.  **Document Upload**: Allows users to upload their own PDF or TXT files, which are then processed, embedded, and added to the chatbot's knowledge base, enabling personalized information retrieval.
5.  **Multi-LLM Support**: Provides seamless integration with various LLM providers, allowing users to select their preferred model based on performance, cost, or specific requirements.

## Slide 7: Development Approach & Challenges

**Heading:** Iterative Development and Problem-Solving

**Content:**
Our development process was iterative, focusing on integrating core functionalities and refining them. Key challenges and our solutions included:

*   **Vector Store Persistence**: Initially, the vector store was rebuilt on every run. This was resolved by implementing save/load functionality for the FAISS index, ensuring faster startup and consistent knowledge.
*   **Context Window Management**: Balancing the amount of retrieved context and chat history to fit within LLM token limits while maintaining comprehensive responses required careful prompt engineering and chunking strategies.
*   **Multiple LLM Integration**: Developing a unified interface for different LLM APIs (OpenAI, Groq, Google Gemini) to ensure smooth switching and consistent interaction patterns.
*   **Document Processing Robustness**: Handling diverse document formats (PDF, TXT) and ensuring effective chunking and embedding for optimal RAG performance.

## Slide 8: Deployment Strategy

**Heading:** Streamlined Cloud Deployment

**Content:**
The chatbot is deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**, providing a simple and efficient way to host the application. The deployment process involves:

1.  **GitHub Integration**: Connecting the application's GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud.
2.  **Dependency Management**: Ensuring all required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
3.  **API Key Management**: Securely configuring API keys as environment variables within the Streamlit Cloud dashboard, adhering to best practices for sensitive information.
4.  **Continuous Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud automatically deploys updates upon new commits to the connected GitHub branch.

## Slide 9: Conclusion & Future Enhancements

**Heading:** A Foundation for Advanced Medical AI

**Content:**
This project successfully demonstrates the creation of an intelligent, versatile, and user-friendly healthcare information assistant. It showcases the power of combining RAG, web search, and multiple LLMs to deliver accurate and context-rich responses.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   **Advanced NLP**: Incorporate medical entity recognition and relation extraction for more precise information retrieval.
*   **Multimodal Support**: Allow image or voice input for symptom analysis or medical image interpretation.
*   **Personalized Health Records**: Secure integration with anonymized patient data for personalized insights (with strict privacy controls).
*   **Proactive Health Alerts**: Develop features to provide proactive health advice based on user profiles or common health trends.
*   **User Feedback Loop**: Implement mechanisms for users to rate responses and improve model performance.
