Hypertension (High Blood Pressure): A Comprehensive Guide

Understanding Hypertension:
Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. Hypertension is often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms until it has done significant damage to the heart and arteries.

Blood Pressure Categories:
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (top number) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The diastolic pressure (bottom number) measures the pressure in your arteries between beats. Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure ranges from 120-129 systolic and less than 80 diastolic. Stage 1 hypertension is 130-139 systolic or 80-89 diastolic. Stage 2 hypertension is 140/90 mm Hg or higher. A hypertensive crisis requires immediate medical attention when readings exceed 180/120 mm Hg.

Causes and Risk Factors:
There are two types of hypertension. Primary (essential) hypertension has no identifiable cause and tends to develop gradually over many years. Secondary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition such as kidney disease, thyroid problems, sleep apnea, or certain medications. Risk factors include age (risk increases as you age), race (particularly common among people of African heritage), family history, being overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, too much salt in your diet, too little potassium in your diet, drinking too much alcohol, stress, and certain chronic conditions.

Symptoms:
Most people with hypertension have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. Some people with high blood pressure may experience headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds, but these signs and symptoms aren't specific and usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage. Because hypertension often has no symptoms, it's important to have regular blood pressure checks.

Complications:
The excessive pressure on your artery walls caused by high blood pressure can damage your blood vessels and organs. The higher your blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to heart attack or stroke, aneurysm, heart failure, weakened and narrowed blood vessels in your kidneys, thickened, narrowed, or torn blood vessels in the eyes, metabolic syndrome, trouble with memory or understanding, and dementia.

Diagnosis:
To diagnose high blood pressure, your healthcare provider will review your medical history, conduct a physical examination, and take blood pressure readings. Because blood pressure normally varies throughout the day and may be elevated during a doctor visit (white coat hypertension), your provider will likely take several blood pressure readings at different appointments. You may also be asked to record your blood pressure at home and at work to provide additional information.

Treatment and Management:
Changing your lifestyle can help control and manage high blood pressure. Your healthcare provider may recommend eating a heart-healthy diet with less salt, getting regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're overweight or obese, limiting alcohol consumption, not smoking, managing stress, and getting good quality sleep. If lifestyle changes alone aren't enough to lower your blood pressure, your healthcare provider may prescribe medication. Several types of medications are available to treat high blood pressure including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers.

Prevention:
The same healthy lifestyle changes recommended to treat high blood pressure also help prevent it. If you've been diagnosed with prehypertension (blood pressure between 120/80 and 139/89), these changes can help prevent the development of full-blown hypertension. Even if you don't have high blood pressure, following these recommendations can help keep your blood pressure in a healthy range and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. Regular monitoring and working closely with your healthcare provider are key to successfully managing or preventing hypertension.
