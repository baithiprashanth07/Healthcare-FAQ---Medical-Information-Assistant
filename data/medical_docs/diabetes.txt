Diabetes: Understanding, Managing, and Living Well

What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. When you eat, your body breaks down most of the food into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.

With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.

Types of Diabetes:
There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant).

Type 1 Diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction that stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of people who have diabetes have Type 1. Symptoms often develop quickly and it's usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. People with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to survive.

Type 2 Diabetes occurs when your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have Type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults, though more and more children, teens, and young adults are also developing it. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes.

Gestational Diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born but increases your risk for Type 2 diabetes later in life.

Common Symptoms:
Symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst and urination, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the feet or hands, sores that do not heal, and unexplained weight loss. Symptoms of Type 1 diabetes can start quickly, in a matter of weeks. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes often develop slowly over several years and can be so mild that you might not even notice them.

Risk Factors:
Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include being overweight or obese, being age 45 or older, having a family history of diabetes, being physically active less than three times a week, having had gestational diabetes, and having prediabetes. You can prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes with proven lifestyle changes such as losing weight if you're overweight, eating healthier, and getting regular physical activity.

Management and Treatment:
Managing diabetes involves keeping your blood glucose level as close to normal as possible. This includes monitoring blood sugar levels, taking medications as prescribed, following a healthy eating plan, being physically active, and maintaining a healthy weight. Regular check-ups with your healthcare team are essential. Many people with Type 2 diabetes can manage their condition with lifestyle changes alone, while others may need medication or insulin.

Complications:
Over time, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart. People with diabetes are also more likely to have other conditions that raise the risk for heart disease including high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Diabetes can also cause kidney damage, eye problems including blindness, foot problems, and skin conditions.

Living Well with Diabetes:
With proper management, people with diabetes can live long, healthy lives. This includes regular monitoring of blood sugar, taking prescribed medications, eating a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins, staying physically active, managing stress, getting adequate sleep, and avoiding tobacco use. Education and support from healthcare providers, diabetes educators, and support groups can make a significant difference in managing the condition effectively.
