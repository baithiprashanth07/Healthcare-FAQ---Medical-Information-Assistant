Common Cold: Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention

Overview:
The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. It is one of the most frequent illnesses, leading to more doctor visits and absences from school and work than any other illness each year.

Symptoms:
Symptoms of a common cold usually appear one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Signs and symptoms may include:
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Sore throat
- Cough
- Congestion
- Slight body aches or mild headache
- Sneezing
- Low-grade fever
- Generally feeling unwell (malaise)

The discharge from the nose may become thicker and yellow or green in color as a common cold runs its course. This is not an indication of a bacterial infection.

Duration:
Most people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke.

Treatment:
There is no cure for the common cold. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms:
- Rest and sleep to help your body fight the infection
- Drink plenty of fluids (water, juice, clear broth, or warm lemon water)
- Soothe a sore throat with ice chips, sore throat spray, or lozenges
- Use saline nasal drops or sprays to relieve stuffiness
- Over-the-counter cold and cough medications for adults and children older than 5 years

Prevention:
To reduce your risk of catching a cold:
- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
- Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth
- Stay away from people who are sick
- Don't share drinking glasses or utensils with others
- Keep surfaces clean, especially in the kitchen and bathroom
- Use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available
- Strengthen your immune system by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep
